# RaspberryPi

This is my repo of me setting up my Raspberry PI as a multipurpose device to host multiple personal / fun projects

# Setting up 

Following a guide I set up my PI with its desired OS https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
I wanted to initally create my own VPN server to be able to use it for HTB and feel "secure" while browsing the web
Once I flashed the OS onto the Micro SD with 32 GB I booted it up and updated everything by SSH-ing into the PI
